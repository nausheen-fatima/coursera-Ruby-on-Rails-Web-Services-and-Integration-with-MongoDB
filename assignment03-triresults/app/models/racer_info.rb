  # The following code block demonstrates creating a getter and setter method 
  # for each of our Address properties within the RacerInfo class â€“ making sure 
  # to apply the single field change to an entire instance of Account that
  # was created from the current state and re-assigned as a whole object.
  #   - city and state are defined in an array that is passed in as the action to perform
  #   - two methods are created; (action) and (action)= to act as the getter and setter for that property
  #   - both perform nil checks on the residence
  #   - the getter pulls the desired field from the embedded custom type
  #   - the setter applies the value to the desired field and re-assigns the state for the the entire custom type
